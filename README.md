# Starwits implementation of AI Cockpit transparency API

Complex software systems that uses AI mechanisms are difficult to understand. This API is part of an effort to add transparency and control to such systems. It is Starwit Technologies' implementation of the transparency interface. It shall provide statistical insights to an AI system's capabilities and give users an easy as possible way to understand, how this system work.

API reference can be found here: <https://gitlab.opencode.de/ki-cockpit/ai-cockpit-api/-/blob/main/api/transparency/ai-cockpit-transparency.yml?ref_type=heads>

More details can be found at <https://www.kicockpit.eu/>. All shared components necessary for this repo can be found [here](https://github.com/KI-Cockpit/ai-cockpit-api). There you also can find more info about all other activities & results of this project.

## Overview

This implementation aims to be a micro service, that can be deployed into a system landscape, that contains complex AI-based decision mechanism. It is written in Java / Spring Boot and was initially generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.

## Starwit's implementation

This component is part of Starwit's implementation for an AI Cockpit. For an overview of all components see [deployment repo](https://github.com/starwit/ai-cockpit-deployment).

## Run Docker image

    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 starwit-aicapi-transparency

Once running you can access:

* interactive API at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
* API spec at: [http://localhost:8080/v0/api-docs/](http://localhost:8080/v0/api-docs/)

## Build & run locally

Application can be build and run like so:

```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/starwit-aicapi-transparency-x.y.z.jar
```

This app needs other components to function properly:

* Minio -> upload sbom, pdf & excel reports
* sbom-generator -> create pdf/excel reports from sboms
* ai-cockpit & database

In folder [docker-compose](deployment/docker-compose/) a docker compose file starts all necessary components. This can be started this way:

```bash
docker compose -f start-services-noauth.yaml up
```

To start fresh shutdown all services like so:

```bash
docker compose -f start-services-noauth.yaml down -v
```

For more details how to use Docker compose, [see readme](deployment/docker-compose/Readme.md).

After successful start api documentation is available at:
<http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html>
